title: Cloud Pak for Data LDAP configuration

# Cloud Pak for Data LDAP

Cloud Pak for Data can connect to an LDAP user registry for identity and access managment (IAM). When configured, for a Cloud Pak for Data instance, a user must authenticate with the user name and password stored in the LDAP server.

If SAML is also configured for the Cloud Pak for Data instance, authentication (identity) is managed by the SAML server but access management (groups, roles) can still be served by LDAP.

Example LDAP configuration:
```
# Each Cloud Pak for Data Deployment deployed in an OpenShift Project of an OpenShift cluster can have its own LDAP configuration
cp4d_ldap_config:
- project: zen-sample
  openshift_cluster_name: sample
  ldap_host: ldaps://ldap-host
  ldap_port: 636
  ldap_user_search_base: ou=users,dc=ibm,dc=com
  ldap_user_search_field: uid
  ldap_domain_search_user: uid=ibm_roks_bind_user,ou=users,dc=ibm,dc=com
  ldap_domain_search_password_vault: ldap_bind_password
  auto_signup: "false"
  ldap_group_search_base: ou=groups,dc=ibm,dc=com
  ldap_group_search_field: cn
  ldap_mapping_first_name: cn
  ldap_mapping_last_name: sn
  ldap_mapping_email: mail
  ldap_mapping_group_membership: memberOf
  ldap_mapping_group_member: member
```

The above configuration uses the LDAPS protocol to connect to port `636` on the `ldap-host` server. This server can be a private server if an upstream DNS server is also defined for the OpenShift cluster that runs Cloud Pak for Data. Common Name `uid=ibm_roks_bind_user,ou=users,dc=ibm,dc=com` is used as the bind user for the LDAP server and its password is retrieved from vault secret `ldap_bind_password`.
