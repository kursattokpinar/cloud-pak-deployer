# Upstream DNS servers

When deploying OpenShift in a private network, one may want to reach additional private network services by their host name. Examples could be a database server, Hadoop cluster or an LDAP server.  OpenShift provides a DNS operator which deploys and manages CoreDNS which takes care of name resolution for pods running inside the container platform, also known as DNS forwarding.

If the services that need to be reachable our registered on public DNS servers, you typically do not have to configure upstream DNS servers.

The upstream DNS used for a particular OpenShift cluster is configured like this:
```
openshift:
- name: sample
...
  upstream_dns:
  - name: sample-dns
    zones:
    - example.com
    dns_servers:
    - 172.31.2.73:53
```

Any host name of which the domain ends with `example.com` will be resolved using private DNS server `172.31.2.73:53`. Typically the private DNS server have one or more upstream DNS servers configured to resolve public services such as `ibm.com`.

For more info on configuring upstream DNS servers check the [Upstream DNS](/cpd-design/objects/openshift#upstream-dns-servers) section of the OpenShift configuration.
