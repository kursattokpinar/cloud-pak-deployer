# Infrastructure

For some of the cloud platforms, you can explicitly specify the infrastructure layer on which the OpenShift cluster(s) will be provisioned. Other cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure provision the infrastructure as of the OpenShift configuration.

For IBM Cloud, you can configure the VPC, subnets, NFS server(s), other Virtual Server Instance(s) and a number of other objects. These objects are documented in the [Infrastructure - IBM Cloud](/cpd-design/objects/infrastructure#ibm-cloud) section.

When provisioning OpenShift on vSphere, you can configure data center, data store, network and virtual machine definitions. These objects are documented in the [Infrastructure - vSphere](/cpd-design/objects/infrastructure#vsphere) page.

For Azure ARO you configure a single object with information about the virtual network (vnet) to be used and the node server profiles. You can find more information here: [Infrastructure - Azure](/cpd-design/objects/infrastructure#microsoft-azure) page.
