# Cloud Pak for Data cartridges

Defines the services (cartridges) which must be installed into the Cloud Pak for Data instances. The cartridges will be configured with the storage class defined at the Cloud Pak for Data object level. For each cartridge you can specify whether it must be installed or removed by specifying the state. If a cartridge is installed and the state is changed to `removed`, the cartridge is removed by the deployer when it is run.

An example Cloud Pak for Data object with cartridges is below:
```
cp4d:
- project: zen-40
  openshift_cluster_name: sample
  cp4d_version: 4.0
  use_case_files: True
  openshift_storage_name: ocs-storage
  
  cartridges:
  - name: cp-foundation
    case_version: 1.6.0
  - name: lite
    subscription_channel: v2.0
    version: 4.0.1
    case_version: 2.0.4

  - name: db2
    version: 4.0.8
    subscription_channel: v1.0
    case_version: 4.0.8
    size: small
    instances:
    - name: db2-instance
      metadata_size_gb: 20
      data_size_gb: 20
      backup_size_gb: 20  
      transactionlog_size_gb: 20
    state: installed

  - name: wkc
    version: 4.0.6
    subscription_channel: v1.0
    case_version: 4.0.6
    size: small
    state: removed

  - name: wml
    version: 4.0.6
    subscription_channel: v1.1
    case_version: 4.0.7
    size: small
    state: installed

  - name: wml-accelerator
    version: 2.3.6
    subscription_channel: v1.0
    case_version: 2.3.6
    replicas: 1
    size: small
    state: removed

  - name: wsl
    version: 4.0.6
    subscription_channel: v2.0
    case_version: 2.0.6
    state: installed
```

When run, the deployer installs the Db2 OLTP (`db2`), Watson Machine Learning (`wml`) and Watson Studio (`wsl`) cartridges. If any of the Watson Knowledge Catalog (`wkc`) or Watson Machine Learning Accelerator (`wml-accelerator`) cartridges are installed in the `zen-40` OpenShift project, they are removed.

After the deployer installs Db2 OLTP, a new Db2 instance is created with the specified attributes.
