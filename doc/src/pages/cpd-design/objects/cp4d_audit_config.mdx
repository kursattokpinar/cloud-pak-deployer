# Cloud Pak for Data Audit configuration

IBM Cloud Pak for Data has a centralized auditing component for base platform and services auditable events. Audit events include login and logout to the platform, creation and deletion of connections and many more. Services that support auditing are documented here: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/4.0?topic=data-services-that-support-audit-logging

The Cloud Pak Deployer simplifies the recording of audit log entries by means of the OpenShift logging framework, which can in turn be configured to forward entries to various log collectors such as Fluentd, Loki and ElasticSearch.

## `cp4d_audit_config`
A `cp4d_audit_config` entry defines the audit configuration for a Cloud Pak for Data instance (OpenShift project). The main configuration items are the number of replicas and the output. Currently only one output type is supported: `openshift-logging`, which allows the OpenShift logging framework to pick up audit entries and forward to the designated collectors.

When a `cp4d_audit_config` entry exists for a certain `cp4d` project, the `zen-audit-config` ConfigMap is updated and then the audit logging deployment is restarted. If no configuration changes have been made, no restart is done.

Additionally, for the `audit_output` entries, the OpenShift logging `ClusterLogForwarder` instance is updated to forward audit entries to the designated logging output. In the example below the auditing is configured with 2 replicas and an `input` and `pipeline` is added to the `ClusterLogForwarder` instance so output to the matching channel defined in `openshift_logging.logging_output`.

```
cp4d_audit_config:
- project: zen-40
  audit_replicas: 2
  audit_output:
  - type: openshift-logging
    logging_name: loki-audit
```
