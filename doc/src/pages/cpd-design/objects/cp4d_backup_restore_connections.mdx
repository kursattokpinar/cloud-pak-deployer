title: Cloud Pak for Data Backup / Restore Global Platform Connections
---

Using the `cp4d_connection` the Cloud Pak Deployer can be used to create Global Platform connections. The `cp4d_backup_restore_connections` can be used to backup all current configured Global Platform connections, which are either created by the Cloud Pak Deployer or added manually. 

The backup is stored in the `status`/cp4d/exports folder as a json file. 

A backup file can be used to restore global platform connections. A flag can be used to indicate whether if a Global Platform connection with the same name already exists, the restore is skipped.

Using the Cloud Pak Deployer cp4d_backup_restore_connections capability implements the following:
- Connect to the IBM Cloud Pak for Data instance specified using `cp4d_instance` and `openshift_cluster_name`
- If `connections_backup_file` is specified export all Global Platform connections to the specified file in the `status`/cp4d/export/connections folder
- If `connections_restore_file` is specified, load the file and restore the Global Platform connections
- The `connections_restore_overwrite` (true/false) indicates whether if a Global Platform Connection with the same already exists, it will be replaced.
