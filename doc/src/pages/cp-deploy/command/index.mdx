# Open a command line

Sometimes you may need to access the OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift client. For convenience we have made the `oc` command available in the Cloud Pak Deployer and you can start exploring the current OpenShift cluster immediately without having to install the client on your own workstation.

## Prepare for the command line

### Set environment variables
Make sure you have set the **CONFIG_DIR** and **STATUS_DIR** environment variables to the same values when you ran the `env apply` command. This will ensure that the `oc` command will access the OpenShift cluster(s) of that configuration.

## Run the Cloud Pak Deployer commad line
```
./cp-deploy.sh env cmd -e env_id=pluto-01 
```

You should see something like this:
```
Extra parameters (0): env_id=pluto-01

Entering Cloud Pak Deployer command line in a container.
Use the "exit" command to leave the container and return to the hosting server.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing OpenShift client
Current OpenShift context: zen-40
```

Now, you can check the OpenShift cluster version:
```
[root@Cloud Pak Deployer Container ~]$ oc get clusterversion
NAME      VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.8.14    True        False         2d3h    Cluster version is 4.8.14
```

Or, display the list of OpenShift projects:
```
[root@Cloud Pak Deployer Container ~]$ oc get projects | grep -v openshift-
NAME                                               DISPLAY NAME   STATUS

```

## Exit the command line
Once finished, exit out of the container.
```
exit
```
